## Getting Started ðŸš€

This repository includes a Flutter Project for both iOS and Android.

The following steps detail how to get started:
1. Clone this repository on the command line, or download the project as a zip file
2. Install VSCode IDE on your Desktop
3. Open up either an iOS Simulator or Android Emulator in VSCode
4. Open the working directory folder in VSCode
5. Run the following command in the working directory through the terminal: `flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart`
6. Interact and have fun with the app!

There are three flavors for the app: development, staging, and production - all of which should execute at this time. There are also English and Spanish ARB files for localization.

This app was built using BLoC state management, Clean Architecture for concern separation, and the Provider pattern for dependency management

## Using the App in the Simulator / Emulator ðŸ“±
1. Open the App manually by clicking on the app icon, or automatically through VSCode if this is a fresh install
2. View a random coffee image
3. If it pleases you, press the outlined heart icon to add it as a favorite image
4. If you no longer want the current image, you can press the red heart icon to un-favorite the image
5. Press the bottom navigation bar button entitled "Favorite Coffees" with the heart icon to see your favorites
6. Don't see your current favorite yet? Swipe down to refresh the list!
7. Scroll through the list to see all of your favorites, even without internet access!
8. Press the bottom navigation bar button entitled "Random Coffee" with the coffee icon to get a new image
9. Press the button entitled "Get New Coffee Image" to receive a new Random Coffee Image from the web

<img src="readme_images/1.png" alt="Random Coffee Tab" width="200"/><img src="readme_images/2.png" alt="Marked Favorite" width="200"/><img src="readme_images/3.png" alt="Favorites Tab" width="200"/><img src="readme_images/4.png" alt="New Random Image" width="200"/>

## Running Tests ðŸ§ª
Currently, there are 6 widget tests, and all of them pass. These include:
- renders App
- checks Coffee Viewer Navigation Button
- checks Coffee Favorites Navigation Button
- checks Coffee Favorites Screen is Empty
- checks Coffee Viewer Add to Favorites Button
- checks Coffee Favorites Has One Picture

There are two wrapper classes for both Dio and the Database DAO to allow for mocked responses to make widget testing easier.

Due to time constraints, there are no unit tests. However, all of the classes follow the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), making them easy to inject state with the Provider and BLoC patterns, and making them easier to test.

## Known Issues
Although git hub Actions are back up and running for both `main` and `post_submission_updates`, there is a flaky test which fails due to line length issues with formatting which do not appear on my local machine, however, I am still very new to git hub Actions, so I am unable to fix it at this time.

## Next Steps ðŸªœ
1. Add the ability to remove favorites directly from the favorites list
2. Check for internet connectivity, and fail gracefully to account for this
3. Add Email / Text / Social Share capabilities
